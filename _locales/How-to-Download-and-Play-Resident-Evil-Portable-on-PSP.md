# How to Download and Play Resident Evil Portable on PSP
 
Resident Evil Portable is a cancelled game that was supposed to be released for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) in 2010. It was intended to be a spin-off of the Resident Evil series, featuring a new story and gameplay that would appeal to the handheld market. However, the game was never officially announced or shown to the public, and it was eventually scrapped by Capcom.

However, that does not mean that you cannot play Resident Evil on your PSP. There are several ways to enjoy the survival horror franchise on your handheld device, such as:
 
- Downloading and playing Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, Resident Evil: Director's Cut, Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock Edition, Resident Evil: Survivor, or Resident Evil (2002) from the PlayStation Store. These are classic PS1 games that have been ported to the PSP and can be played with the analog stick or the face buttons. They cost $5.99 each and require a memory stick with at least 400 MB of free space.
- Downloading and playing Naruto Shippuden: Kizuna Drive from the PlayStation Store. This is a PSP game that features a crossover between Naruto and Resident Evil, where you can play as Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, or Kakashi and fight against zombies and bioweapons in a fictional city. It costs $19.99 and requires a memory stick with at least 1 GB of free space.
- Downloading and playing Resident Evil 6 PPSSPP ISO file from a third-party website. This is a fan-made mod that converts the PC version of Resident Evil 6 into a PSP-compatible format. It features four campaigns with Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller, and Ada Wong, as well as online co-op and multiplayer modes. However, this method is not recommended as it may be illegal, unsafe, or incompatible with your device. You will need a PSP emulator such as PPSSPP, a PC program such as WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the ISO file, and a memory stick with at least 2 GB of free space.

If you are interested in any of these options, you can follow these steps to download and play Resident Evil on your PSP:

1. Connect your PSP to your PC via USB cable or insert your memory stick into your PC's card reader.
2. Open your PSP's root folder on your PC and create a folder named "ISO" if it does not exist already.
3. Download the game of your choice from the PlayStation Store or a third-party website and save it to your PC.
4. If the game is in ISO format, copy it to the ISO folder on your PSP's memory stick. If the game is in EBOOT.PBP format, copy it to the PSP/GAME folder on your PSP's memory stick.
5. Disconnect your PSP from your PC or remove your memory stick from your PC's card reader.
6. Turn on your PSP and go to the Game menu. Select Memory Stick and launch the game of your choice.
7. Enjoy playing Resident Evil on your PSP!

Note: Some games may require additional steps or settings to run properly on your PSP. Please refer to the instructions or guides provided by the game's source for more information.
